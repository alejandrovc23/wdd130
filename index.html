        <p>Hello! My name is Alejandro Valladares, and I am from Lima, PerÃº. I enjoy to spend time with my family and
            friends and also I really love the peruvian food! I'm currently pursuing two degrees simultaneously. My
            first degree is Industrial and Commercial Engineering at San
            Ignacio de Loyola University, and my second degree is Software Development at BYU. In 2024, I served as a
            missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Colombia, Barranquilla. Regarding my
            hobbies, I enjoy working out at the gym and having fun with my friends and family, as well as watching
            movies and TV shows. I also enjoy cooking occasionally. I'm currently serving as a temple worker in the Lima
            Peru temple
            and as an assistant secretary focused on ward finances.</p>
